### Authorization/authentication issue(s)
- The user, Robert Taylor Jr.	in the legal attorney role, had admin level access.
- The user's account should not have been active because their access ended on the 12/27/2019.

### Authorization/authentication recommendation(s)
- Not all employees should have admin level authorization. Separation of duties should be implented so that the correct levels of authorization to given to each employee in their specific role. This would prevent the system from being misused.
- The principle of least privilege should be implemented so that access can be revoked to files when an employee is no longer with the company.
