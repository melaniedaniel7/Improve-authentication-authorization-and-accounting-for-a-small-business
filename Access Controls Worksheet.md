### Authorization/authentication issue(s)
- The user is Robert Taylor Jr., his role is legal attorney, and he is a contractor. He had admin level access.
- The user's account should not have been active because their access ended on the 12/27/2019.

### Authorization/authentication recommendation(s)
- Not all employees should have admin level authorization. Separation of duties should be implented so that the correct levels of authorization is given to each employee in their specific role. This would prevent the system from being misused.
- The principle of least privilege should be implemented so that access can be revoked to files when an employee is no longer with the company.
- Implementing stronger access controls like password policies and Multi-factor authentication (MFA) would also help protect the business from incidents like this. If access controls like this are not already in place.
