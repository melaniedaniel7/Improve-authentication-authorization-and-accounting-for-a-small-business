Access controls are security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things theyâ€™re allowed to do. When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the likelihood of a security risk.
